:description: A short quiz to validate understanding of RHOAI 3 Storage and Connectivity concepts.

[.lead]
*Did you master the factory floor? Let's find out.*

== Question 1: The Strategy
**Scenario:** A team of 5 researchers needs to access a read-only 2TB dataset of satellite imagery simultaneously. They do not need to modify the images.
**Which storage class strategy is most appropriate?**

* [ ] A. Provision 5 separate RWO volumes and copy the data to each one.
* [ ] B. Provision one RWO volume and have them take turns.
* [x] C. Provision one RWX (ReadWriteMany) volume and mount it to all 5 workbenches as Read-Only.
* [ ] D. Store the images in a Git repository.

_Answer: C. RWX is designed for collaborative access to shared data without duplication._

== Question 2: The Security
**Scenario:** You need to rotate the AWS Access Keys used by the "Fraud Detection" team.
**How do you update the credentials without breaking their code?**

* [ ] A. Email the new keys to the team and ask them to update their notebooks.
* [ ] B. Update the hardcoded values in the `deployment.yaml` file.
* [x] C. Update the Kubernetes Secret associated with the Data Connection.
* [ ] D. Delete the workbench and recreate it.

_Answer: C. Data Connections abstract credentials into Secrets. Updating the Secret automatically propagates the new values to the environment variables upon the next pod start._

== Question 3: The Architecture (RHOAI 3)
**Scenario:** You are deploying a production Model Registry in RHOAI 3.
**Where should the metadata be stored?**

* [ ] A. In a text file on a PVC.
* [ ] B. In an SQLite database on the local node.
* [x] C. In an external MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
* [ ] D. In the OpenShift etcd key-value store.

_Answer: C. RHOAI 3 requires external databases (MySQL/Postgres) for production components like Model Registry and Llama Stack to ensure scalability._

== Question 4: The Configuration
**Scenario:** A user reports their workbench is restarting unexpectedly. You recently changed the global "Default PVC Size" in the Cluster Settings.
**Is this related?**

* [x] A. Yes, changing the default PVC size triggers a rollout restart of workbench pods.
* [ ] B. No, PVC settings only affect new workbenches.

_Answer: A. Modifying the PVC size setting in the dashboard restarts workbench pods and makes them unavailable for up to 30 seconds._
