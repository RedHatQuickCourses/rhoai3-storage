*Configuration is easy. Day-2 Operations are where the battle is won.*

Now that your storage architecture is built, you need to maintain it. Based on RHOAI 3 best practices, here are the five most common "sharp edges" that trip up Platform Engineers.

== 1. The "Protocol" Pitfall (Connectivity)
When configuring Data Connections for S3-compatible stores (like MinIO or NooBaa), the most frequent error is **Endpoint Formatting**.

* **The Error:** Providing an endpoint like `minio-api.cluster.local`.
* **The Fix:** You *must* prefix the protocol.
    ** Correct: `http://minio-api.cluster.local:9000` or `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.
    ** Why? The Boto3 client injected into the workbench requires the full URI scheme to resolve correctly.

== 2. The "Restart" Risk (PVC Management)
You might receive a ticket from a user asking for more disk space: *"My 20GB Workbench is full."*

* **The Action:** You go to **Settings -> Cluster settings** and increase the default PVC size to 50GB.
* **The Warning:** Changing the default PVC size triggers a **restart** of the Workbench Pod.
* **Best Practice:** Perform global storage resizing during maintenance windows. For individual users, expand the PVC manually via the OpenShift Console (`Storage -> PersistentVolumeClaims`) to avoid disrupting the entire cluster configuration.

== 3. The "Corruption" Danger (RWX Volumes)
Shared storage (ReadWriteMany) is powerful, but it is not magic. It is a shared file system.

* **The Risk:** If two users run a script that writes to the *exact same file* (e.g., `model_weights.h5`) simultaneously, you will experience **data corruption** or data loss.
* **The Rule:** Use RWX for **reading** shared datasets. If users need to **write**, they should write to their personal (RWO) folder or use unique filenames (e.g., `experiment_userA_v1.log`).

== 4. The "Trust" Gap (Certificates)
If you are using an on-premise Object Store (MinIO) secured with **Self-Signed Certificates**, your Data Connections will fail silently.

* **The Symptom:** Workbenches hang or Pipeline steps fail with `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`.
* **The Fix:** You must inject the **Cluster CA Bundle** into the component. RHOAI components (Pipelines, Model Serving) need to "trust" your storage backend. Ensure your custom CA bundles are configured in the `DSCI` (Data Science Cluster Initialization) resource.

== 5. The Database Mandate (RHOAI 3 Specific)
Do not attempt to use SQLite for production Model Registries.

* **The Change:** RHOAI 3 deprecates file-based databases for the Model Registry.
* **The Requirement:** You must provision an external **MySQL (8.x)** or **PostgreSQL** database. Using local PVCs for metadata will result in performance bottlenecks and is not supported for production SLAs.

*Configuration is easy. Day-2 Operations are where the battle is won.*

Now that you understand the physics of AI storage, you need to maintain it. In a high-velocity environment, default Kubernetes settings are often insufficient for GenAI workloads.

Based on real-world deployments of Red Hat OpenShift AI 3, here are the **Five Critical Configurations** that separate a stable platform from a fragile one.

== 1. The "Timeout" Trap (OCI Modelcars)


When you use the OCI protocol to stream a 70GB model, the container runtime (CRI-O) must pull all layers before the Pod can start.

 * **The Default:** Knative (the engine behind Model Serving) often has a default `progress-deadline` of **600 seconds (10 minutes)**.
 * **The Failure:** If your network takes 11 minutes to pull the 70GB image, the deployment is marked as `Failed` and the pod is killed—even if it was 99% done.
 * **The Fix:** You must increase the `progressDeadlineSeconds` in your `InferenceService` or global Knative config to **1800s (30 mins)** or more for large foundation models.

== 2. The "Data Loss" Risk (PVC Reclaim Policy)
By default, standard Storage Classes (like `gp3-csi`) have a `reclaimPolicy` of `Delete`.

  * **The Scenario:** A Data Scientist accidentally deletes their project namespace.
  * **The Consequence:** The underlying EBS volume is immediately scrubbed by AWS. The "Golden Dataset" is gone forever.
  * **The Fix:** For any Shared Storage (RWX) hosting critical assets, you must patch the Persistent Volume (PV) to `Retain`.
+
[source,bash]
----
# Protect your Golden Dataset
oc patch pv <pv-name> -p '{"spec":{"persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy":"Retain"}}'
----

== 3. The "Protocol" Pitfall (Connectivity)
When configuring Data Connections for S3-compatible stores (MinIO, NooBaa), the most frequent error is **Endpoint Formatting**.

  * **The Error:** `minio-api.cluster.local`
 * **The Fix:** You *must* include the protocol scheme.
    ** Correct: `http://minio-api.cluster.local:9000`
    ** Correct: `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
    ** *Why?* The Boto3 client injected into the workbench requires the full URI scheme to resolve correctly.

== 4. The "Helper Pod" Pattern (Air-Gapped Loading)
In a disconnected (Air-Gapped) environment, you cannot simply "download" a model from Hugging Face to your PVC.

 * **The Problem:** PVCs are just disks; they don't have internet access.
 * **The Solution:** You must use a **Helper Pod**.
    1.  Spin up a temporary Pod (e.g., `ubi9-minimal`) with the PVC mounted.
    2.  Use `oc cp` to upload the model files from your laptop to the Pod.
    3.  Delete the Helper Pod.
    4.  The data remains on the PVC, ready for the Model Server to mount it as `Read-Only`.

== 5. The Database Mandate (RHOAI 3 Specific)
[IMPORTANT]
.Critical Architecture Change
====
Do not attempt to use SQLite for production Model Registries.
====
 * **The Change:** RHOAI 3 deprecates file-based databases for the Model Registry.
 * **The Requirement:** You must provision an external **MySQL (8.x)** or **PostgreSQL** database.
 * **The Why:** Using local PVCs for metadata results in database locking issues when multiple API servers try to write simultaneously. Production SLAs require a proper DB engine.

*Now that you know where the landmines are, let's deploy the safe path.*
