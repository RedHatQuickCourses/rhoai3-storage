:description: Definitions of Data Connection, PVC, Modelcar, Pipeline Workspace, and RHOAI 3 storage-related terms.

[.lead]
*Shared vocabulary prevents misconfiguration. Use this page as the single source of truth for terms.*

This section defines the key terms used in RHOAI data connectivity and storage. Use it when designing your strategy or when discussing options with your team.

== Core Terms

=== Data Connection

A **Data Connection** is an abstraction over external data access. In RHOAI, it is backed by a Kubernetes Secret that holds credentials and endpoint information (e.g., S3 keys, OCI registry credentials). When you attach a Data Connection to a workbench or serving runtime, the platform injects these values into the pod (e.g., as environment variables) so that the application can access the external system without hardcoded keys.

* **Use for:** S3 buckets, URI-based data sources, OCI registries (e.g., Modelcars).
* **Benefit:** Centralized, auditable, rotatable credentials; same code across environments by swapping the connection.

=== PVC (Persistent Volume Claim)

A **Persistent Volume Claim** is a request for storage that is satisfied by the cluster's storage layer (a Persistent Volume). In RHOAI, PVCs are used for workbench home directories (so your notebooks and caches survive pod restarts) and for **Pipeline Workspaces** (so data can be passed between pipeline steps without re-uploading to S3 after each step).

* **Access modes:** RWO (single node) or RWX (multi-node, for shared datasets).
* **Benefit:** Persistence and fast handoff; less egress and latency than "everything through S3."

=== Modelcar

A **Modelcar** is a method of distributing and serving models using **OCI container images**. Instead of downloading raw model weights from S3 or Hugging Face at container start, the model is packaged as an image (e.g., on `registry.redhat.io`). The serving runtime pulls the image; layers are cached. This reduces startup time and fits enterprise image supply chains (mirroring, scanning, signing).

* **Use for:** Production model serving when you want fast cold start and deduplication.
* **RHOAI:** Prefer Modelcars when available; attach via OCI Data Connection or catalog reference.

=== Pipeline Workspace

A **Pipeline Workspace** is a PVC (or a volume backed by one) that is shared across pipeline steps. Step 1 writes intermediate artifacts to the workspace; Step 2 reads from it. This avoids writing every intermediate result back to S3 and reading it again in the next step—reducing latency and egress cost.

* **Flow:** S3 (input) → workspace (intermediate) → S3 and/or Model Registry (output).

== RHOAI 3–Specific Shifts

=== Llama Stack Storage

In **RHOAI 3**, Llama Stack and related components no longer rely on SQLite on a PVC for all metadata. They require **PostgreSQL** and **Vector Stores** (e.g., Milvus, pgvector) for scalable, production-ready state. Plan for these backing services when deploying Llama Stack–based applications.

=== Metadata and Databases

RHOAI 3 moves metadata for the **Model Registry** and **TrustyAI** from PVC-backed storage to **external databases** (MySQL/PostgreSQL). Ensure these databases are provisioned and that connection details are correctly configured in the platform.
