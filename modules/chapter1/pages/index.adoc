= The Data Supply Chain: Architecting the AI Factory
:navtitle: The Data Supply Chain
:imagesdir: ../images

In the modern AI enterprise, **GPUs are the engine, but data is the fuel.**

Most organizations burn millions on high-performance compute, only to let it sit idle because their data logistics are broken. Data Scientists waste days waiting for IT to open firewall ports. They hardcode AWS credentials into Jupyter notebooks, creating security nightmares. They download terabytes of redundant data to unmanaged block storage because the shared cluster options are "too hard to use."

This is **Shadow AI**.

It is an unmanaged, ungoverned landscape where every model is treated like a unique "pet." It works for one model, but it collapses at scale.



**In this course, you will industrialize your data logistics.**

You will learn to make OpenShift AI storage **work for you**, transforming it from a passive hard drive into an active business asset. You will move beyond the "Wild West" of manual tickets to build a governed **Data Supply Chain** where data flows securely and instantly from your "Cold" Data Lakes to your "Hot" GPU memory.

== The Architecture of Value

When you build an AI platform, you are not just provisioning storage; you are designing the workflow of your organization. Every storage mechanism you choose produces a specific business outcome.

In this course, we will architect three specific layers of value:

=== 1. The Universal Adapter (Data Connections)
* **The Struggle:** Coding for "Direct Access." It is faster today to hardcode an S3 key, but it creates "Vendor Lock-in" and security risks tomorrow.
* **The Solution:** **Data Connections.** You will configure secure, injected secrets that act as universal adapters.
* **The Business Value:** **Portability.** Your code simply asks for `conn-s3`. In Development, the platform points it to a sandbox; in Production, it points to the live warehouse. The code *never changes*, and the data scientist *never sees the password*.

=== 2. The Collaborative Workspace (Cluster Storage)
* **The Struggle:** "It works on my machine." Models live on personal laptops or isolated "ReadWriteOnce" (RWO) volumes. If an employee leaves, their work vanishes with them.
* **The Solution:** **Shared Team Storage (RWX).** You will build the "Assembly Line" where multiple researchers mount the same high-speed volume to collaborate on datasets and share weights simultaneously.
* **The Business Value:** **Institutional Memory.** Data and code become team assets, not personal artifacts.

=== 3. Just-In-Time Delivery (Modelcars & OCI)
* **The Struggle:** Every deployment starts by downloading a 20GB model file to disk, wasting minutes of startup time and racking up egress fees.
* **The Solution:** **OCI Modelcars.** You will treat models like software artifacts, streaming weights directly from the container registry to the node's memory.
* **The Business Value:** **Velocity.** Deployments that took minutes now take seconds.

== Your Learning Path

We have structured this course to take you from concept to code:

1.  **The Blueprint (Next Module):** We will dive deep into the technical architecture. You will learn how `ConnectionTypes` create the standards, how `RWX` backing stores differ from `RWO`, and how the Metadata Layer (External Databases) powers the entire system.
2.  **The Implementation (Hands-On Lab):** You will act as the Factory Architect. Using a GitOps approach, you will deploy three standardized configuration files to instantly provision:
    * A secure **S3 Data Connection** to a Data Lake.
    * A high-performance **Shared Storage** volume for team collaboration.
    * A public **OCI Modelcar** connection for instant model streaming.
